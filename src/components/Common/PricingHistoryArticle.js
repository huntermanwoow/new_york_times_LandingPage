                    <p className="mb-6">1913 is the year the Federal Reserve was signed into law by Woodrow Wilson. I chose this year because I wanted to show how much of a problem inflation is and how our token fights it. The fight is simple, we backed 1913$ with real estate, a very strong inflation resistant asset.</p>

                    <p className="mb-6">As you look at how the dollar has been debased, notice how it has accelerated after 1971, the year we came off the gold standard.</p>
